# Lectern Sync for Fantasy Grounds

This directory contains the implementation workspace for one-way Fantasy Grounds Unity 5E to Lectern synchronization.

The extension is versioned with the snapshot contract and supports the Fantasy Grounds Unity `5E` ruleset. It exports loaded class, subclass, species/race, feat, and background records; player characters; prepared encounters; and live Combat Tracker state.
